# Lake Tanganyika
This is the code used to generate analyses and figures from my preprint on Lake Tanganyika genomes.

Thank you for citing our pre-print:

# Genomes
I've uploaded the metagenome-assembled-genomes (MAGs) on the Open Science Framework for viewing and downloading while the preprint is up, and during the peer-review process.
However, the genomes have been uploaded to NCBI Genbank and will be officially released with Accessed ID on the real publication date.
