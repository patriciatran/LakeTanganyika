# Abstract
Lake Tanganyika, the largest tropical freshwater lake and the second largest by volume on Earth is characterized by strong oxygen and redox gradients. In spite of the majority of its water column being anoxic, Tanganyika hosts some of the most diverse and prolific fisheries and ecosystems on Earth. Yet, little is known about microorganisms inhabiting this lake, and their impacts on biogeochemistry and nutrient cycling underlying ecosystem structure and productivity. Here, we apply depth-discrete metagenomics, single-cell genomics, and geochemical analyses to reconstruct and characterize 3979 microbial genomes representing 803 non-redundant organisms from 81 bacterial and archaeal phyla, including two novel bacterial candidate phyla, Tanganyikabacteria and Ziwabacteria. We found sharp contrasts in community composition and metabolism between the oxygenated mixed upper layer compared to deep anoxic waters, with core freshwater taxa in the former, and Archaea and uncultured Candidate Phyla in the latter. Nitrogen cycling was dominant in the anoxic zone highlighting microbial contribution to upwelled nutrients to the productive surface layers, and greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide. Overall, we provide a window into how oxygen gradients shape microbial community metabolism in widespread anoxic tropical freshwaters, and advocate for the importance of anoxic freshwater habitats in the context of global biogeochemical cycles and nutrient cycling.
